# Rigidbody

This is an overview of the unity Rigidbody via Toy. If you want to learn how to work with or extend the plugin yourself, please see [this tutorial here](tutorial_unity.md).

## PositionX

This is the X position of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## PositionY

This is the Y position of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## PositionZ

This is the Z position of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## VelocityX

This is the X velocity of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## VelocityY

This is the Y velocity of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## VelocityZ

This is the Z velocity of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## AngularVelocityX

This is the X angular velocity of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## AngularVelocityY

This is the Y angular velocity of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## AngularVelocityZ

This is the Z angular velocity of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## RotationX

This is the X rotation of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## RotationY

This is the Y rotation of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## RotationZ

This is the Z rotation of the Rigidbody in local space. It can be changed.

## AddForce(x, y, z, mode)

This is Unity's [Rigidbody.AddForce()](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html).

"x", "y" and "z" are the direction of the force, while "mode" has these options:

* force
* acceleration
* impulse
* velocity

## AddTorque(x, y, z, mode)

This is Unity's [Rigidbody.AddTorque()](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddTorque.html).

"x", "y" and "z" are the direction of the torque, while "mode" has these options:

* force
* acceleration
* impulse
* velocity

## GameObject

This is the [Unity GameObject](reference_unity_gameobject.md).
