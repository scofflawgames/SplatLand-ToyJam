## PositionX

This is the X position of the Rigidbody2D. It can be changed.

## PositionY

This is the Y position of the Rigidbody2D. It can be changed.

## VelocityX

## AddForce(x, y, mode)

This is Unity's [Rigidbody2D.AddForce()](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.AddForce.html).

This function takes three parameters. The first two are the X and Y values of the force, and the third is the force mode. Acceptable arguments for "mode" are "force" and "impulse".
