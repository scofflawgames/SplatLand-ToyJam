# Libraries

Several libraries are provided by default with Toy, and can be accessed via the `import` [keyword](reference_language.md#Import).

```
import "Toy"; //the meta-library
import "Standard" as std; //aliasing is supported
```

The functions provided are implemented in native code, rather than written in Toy.

* [Toy](reference_libraries_toy.md)
* [Standard](reference_libraries_standard.md)
* [String](reference_libraries_string.md)
* [Math](reference_libraries_math.md)
