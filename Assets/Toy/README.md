# Toy

This is the Toy programming language interpreter, written in C#.

My goal for writing this language is simply to have fun and to learn, but also to create something that *could* be usable in an actual dev environment, particularly as an extension for the Unity game engine.

The docs can be found under docs/, or you could start [here](docs/reference_language.md).

To see an example of Toy working in Unity, checkout my [flappybirb example](https://github.com/Ratstail91/flappybirb).

Special thanks to http://craftinginterpreters.com/ for their fantastic book that I followed to write this.
